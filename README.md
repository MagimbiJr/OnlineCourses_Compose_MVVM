# Online Courses 
This application built using Jetpack Compose.
In this app, I used PluralSight android app design and concept with minor differences.

## Architecture
This application follows new recommended architecture by Google. It follows MVVM pattern.

## More Information

This app is a work on progress. Many features of this app are not yet implemented.
So far, there is no backend yet, the data that the app depends on are hard coded within a 
kotlin files (list of items) and manipulate them as if they are from the remote source.

The feature plan is to create backend for all the data needed by the app.
